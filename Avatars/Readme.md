# Avatars

## What is here

All assets used to make these avatars sorted by platform.

## Do you own all of these assets?

Unless otherwise stated in a readme in the package/zip yes. 

When I don't own an asset I will say where I got it in either a credit.txt file or in a readme.md in the package.

## Can I use anything here in my own projects?

As long as I made it: its [CC0(Public Domain)](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) so sure go nuts.

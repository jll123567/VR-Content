# Pool House

## Description

This is an aproximate replica of a real place. It's pretty cool. Its a house and a pool. Yeah.

All assets I've made are free to use. Everything else was free and has been linked below.

Hope you enjoy!

## UPDATE
This world is also available in cvr, and uses [CVR's CCK](https://developers.abinteractive.net/cck/setup/). Download that for setup.
The CVR version does not use cyanemu, udonsharp, or ProTv.

## Dependencies

This project needs cyanemu, udonsharp, ProTv, and the vrchat sdk to work. Please import them before importing this package. They are linked below.
